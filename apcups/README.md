# APC UPS

## Requirements

A running **apcupsd** with configured netserver (NIS). The plugin retrieves the information via network from the netserver. No local apcupsd is required.
The apcupsd package must be installed also on the local system (running daemon is not required). The plugin uses the **apcaccess** helper tool from the package.

If running the daemon locally and using the netserver, then the ``/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf`` should contain additionally the following entries:

```
NETSERVER on
NISPORT 3551
NISIP 127.0.0.1
```

## Supported Hardware

Should work on all APC UPS devices. Tested only on a "smartUPS".

## Configuration

### plugin.yaml

Add the following lines to activate the plugin:

```yaml
ApcUps:
    class_name: APCUPS
    class_path: plugins.apcups
    host: localhost
    port: 3551
```

Description of the attributes:

* __host__: ip address of the NIS (optional, default: localhost)
* __port__: port of the NIS (optional, default: 3551)
* __cycle__: time to update the items with values from apcaccess

### items.yaml

There is only one attribute: **apcups**

For a list of values for this attribute call "apcaccess" on the command line. This command will give back a text block containing a list of ``statusname : value`` entries like the following:

The plugin will check the items type. If the type is a string, then the value will we returned as a string (e.g. status "ONLINE").
If it is of type num, then the item will be set to a float. To convert to a float, the returned string will be cut after first space and the converted (e.g. 235 Volt = 235).

### Example

The example below will read the keys **LINEV**, **STATUS** and **TIMELEFT** and returns their values.

```yaml
# items/apcups.yaml
serverroom:

    apcups:

        linev:
            visu_acl: ro
            type: num
            apcups: linev

        status:
            # will be 'ONLINE', 'ONBATT', or in case of a problem simply empty
            visu_acl: ro
            type: str
            apcups: status

        timeleft:
            visu_acl: ro
            type: num
            apcups: timeleft
```

**type** depends on the values.

### Status Report Fields

Due to a look into this http://apcupsd.org/manual/manual.html#configuration-examples file the meaning of the above variables are as follows

```
APC
    Header record indicating the STATUS format revision level, the number of records that follow the APC statement, and the number of bytes that follow the record.
DATE
    The date and time that the information was last obtained from the UPS.
HOSTNAME
    The name of the machine that collected the UPS data.
UPSNAME
    The name of the UPS as stored in the EEPROM or in the UPSNAME directive in the configuration file.
