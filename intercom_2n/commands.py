        restart (storing of events occurring after the channel is opened), or be filled with all or
        some events from the event history records.
        Use the duration parameter to define the channel duration if it is not accessed via
        /api/log/pull . The channel will be closed automatically when the defined timeout
        passes as if the /api/log/unsubscribe function were used.
