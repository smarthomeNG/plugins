# DMX

## Requirements

This plugin needs one of the supported DMX interfaces:

   * [NanoDMX](http://www.dmx4all.de/)
   * [DMXking](http://www.dmxking.com) it should work with other Enttec Pro compatible as well.

and pyserial.

```bash
apt-get install python-serial
```

## Configuration

### plugin.yaml

```yaml
dmx:
    class_name: DMX
    class_path: plugins.dmx
    tty: /dev/usbtty...
    # interface = nanodmx
```

With ``interface``  you could choose between ``nanodmx`` and ``enttec``. By default nanodmx is used.

You have to adapt the tty to your local enviroment. In my case it's ``/dev/usbtty-1-2.4`` because I have the following udev rule:

```bash
# /etc/udev/rules.d/80-smarthome.rules
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb",KERNEL=="ttyACM*",ATTRS{product}=="NanoDMX Interface",SYMLINK+="usbtty-%b"
```

### items.yaml

#### dmx_ch

With this attribute you could specify one or more DMX channels.

### Example

```yaml
living_room:

    dimlight:
        type: num
        dmx_ch:
          - '10'
          - '11'
```

Now you could simply use:
``sh.living_room.dimlight(80)`` to dim the living room light.

## Functions

### send(channel, value)

Sends the value to the given dmx channel. The value could be ``0`` to ``255``.

Example: ``sh.dmx.send(12, 255)``
