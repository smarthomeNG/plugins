==============
OpenWeatherMap
==============

This Plugin is used to receive weather information via OpenWeatherMap (https://openweathermap.org/).

The following APIs of OpenWeatherMap are supported:

- weather
- forecast
- uvi (deprecated)
- onecall
- onecall-0...onecall-4 uses the time-machine feature provided by the one-call-api, to collect the "historic" data, which includes past values of today (onecall-0).
- layer, providing map tile-data.
- airpollution



Requirements
=============
An api key from OpenWeatherMap is needed. It can be obtained free of charge from https://openweathermap.org.

The api key which is available free of charge allows up to 60 calls a minute.
Keep this in mind:
- if you want to change the update frequency using the cycle parameter.
- this plugin uses multiple calls per update-cycle. It may sum up to 10 calls per cycle. If you use the same API-key in SmartVisu, this will as well consume your call-quota.


Migrating from previous version 1.5.1
=====================================

Plugin-parameters
-----------------

* A new parameter altitude has been added, to reflect the height above sea-level (needed for ETO-calculation). If this parameter is omitted, the plugin will default to the complete longitude, latitude and altitude configuration of SHNG.
* You can check the interpretation of the current coordinates in the Web-Interface by clicking the top-right table's coordinates values. A zoomable-map with a precise pointer will be displayed.
* 'softfail_precipitation' and 'softfail_wind_gust' can be used to define the behaviour for missing values for missing 'rain', 'snow' and 'wind_gust' values. The default behaviour is to assume 0 precipitation if the value is not provided, for wind_gust, the wind_speed value will be used.


Item-attributes
---------------

* 'x', 'y', 'z' attributes for the map-layers have been renamed to owm_coord_x, owm_coord_y and owm_coord_z - but they can be omitted completely, as they are calculated from the plugin-coordinates, which themselves default to the geo-coordinates of SHNG.


Hints
-----

* In older versions of the OpenWeatherMap-API the match_strings 'main/grnd_level' and 'main/sea_level' could be used to obtain different air-pressure values. Nowadays this should be obtained using 'current/pressure'
* The uvi-API is deprecated by OWM. So instead of using 'uvi_value' please use 'current/uvi', that will deliver the same value. For the next release this will be automatically replaced and respective warnings will appear in the log.


Functionality
=============

Save raw JSON-string to item
----------------------------

Use the "data-source-keys" to identify the respective data-source.

.. code:: yaml

    complete_onecall_json:
        type: str
        owm_raw_file: onecall




General Information
-------------------

The data provided by OpenWeatherMap is mapped to items by matchstrings. A matchstring is defining the path to a data-source within an API-response field.
The available resources make use of the following APIs:

- weather
- forecast
- uvi deprecated
- onecall
- onecall-0...onecall-4 uses the time-machine feature provided by the one-call-api, to collect the "historic" data, which includes past values of today (onecall-0).
- layer, providing map tile-data.
- airpollution

The list before is providing the names of the "data-source-keys" that are used within this plugin. You can see the results of the last calls within the web-interface of this plugin. The plugin identifies the need for downloading data from each endpoint by the definition of the respective matchstring. If no matchstring would require data from e.g. the data-source "weather", then this endpoint would not be called by the plugin. The prefferable way of reading weather-data is via the one-call API.

Data is retrieved in metric units (m, mm, hPa, °C).

In order to access the data that can be retrieved via the API an attribute of "owm_matchstring" is needed. Optionally you can add a "owm_match_prefix". That string is prepended to the "owm_matchstring" given.

.. code:: yaml

    forecast_daily1_no_prefix:
        type: str
        remark: This is a valid way of adressing the description of tomorrows weather
        owm_matchstring@home: day/1/weather/0/description

    forecast_daily1_with_prefix:
        type: str
        remark: here the match-string is compiled as day/1/weather/0/description
        owm_match_prefix@home: day/1
        owm_matchstring@home: /weather/0/description

        temp_night:
            type: num
            remark: here the match-string is compiled as day/1/temp/night, inheriting the prefix from the parent-element.
            owm_match_prefix@home: ../.
            owm_matchstring@home: /temp/night


Soft-failing matching
---------------------
The typical matching would access the root of the JSON-response of an API call and then follow the provided path to select the items from the response "tree". If the next node along the path cannot be matched an ERROR will be logged. Typically this is caused by typos or missing / wrong integer-indices on counted items.
Unfortunately not all responses from OWM will always contain a value. For example rain or snow data is only included if rain or snow has actually fallen or will be falling. For matchstrings ending in 'snow/3h', 'snow/1h', 'rain/3h' or 'rain/1h' an unmatched item will receive the value 0 instead of None. This will be logged as a DEBUG-level message (if enabled).


Matchstring-Rewriting / Data-Source identification
--------------------------------------------------
Matchstrings are re-written by the plugin to allow a clear distinction of the data-sources while maintaining readability. The start of a matchstring provides a hint on the utilized data-source:

- begins with "virtual/", see Virtual matchstrings example: virtual/past24h/sum/rain/1h for the total amount of rain in the past 24h.
- begins with "forecast/daily/", see Daily forecast (calculated) example: forecast/daily/0/main/temp_min for tomorrows minimal temperature. consider using the one-call equivalents, e.g. day/1/temp/min to retrieve the same value as in the example
- ends with "/eto" and begins with "current/" or "daily/", see Evapotranspiration example: daily/1/eto for tomorrows ETO-value.
- begins with "forecast/" original data-source is the forecast-API: the prefix "forecast/" is replaced with "list/" when matching items in the JSON-source. example: forecast/1/main/humidity to retrieve the forecasted humidity three hours in the future.
- begins with "uvi" original data-source is the uvi-API: the prefix "uvi" is removed when matching items in the JSON-source. example: uvi_value to get the current UV-index value as this API is deprecated, the replacement is current/uvi, it may be automatically replaced in future versions of this plugin.
- begins with "current/" original data-source is the onecall-API, values are read directly. example: current/weather/description for a text describing the current weather in the defined language.
- begins with "hour/I/" where I is a number between 0 and 47 representing the relative hour from now onwards. Original data-source is the onecall-API the prefix "hour/" is replaced with "hourly/" when matching items in the JSON-source. example: hour/2/feels_like to get the perceived temperature two hours from now. complete set of data-points that can be retrieved for each hour:

    - dt: Point in time represented by this data-point
    - temp: Temperature in Celsius
    - feels_like: Perceived Temperature
    - pressure: Atmospheric pressure on the sea level, hPa
    - humidity: Relative Humidity in %
    - dew_point: Atmospheric temperature (varying according to pressure and humidity) below which water droplets begin to condense and dew can form. Celsius
    - uvi: UV index
    - clouds: Cloudiness %
    - rain/1h: Rain volume in mm
    - snow/1h: Snow volume in mm
    - visibility: Average visibility, metres
    - wind_speed: Wind speed in metre/sec (this can be extended as wind_speed/beaufort and wind_speed/description to get the Beaufort-value and the Description of the Speed-level in German or English)
    - wind_deg: Wind direction, degrees (meteorological)
    - wind_gust: Wind gust (peaks in speed) in metre/sec
    - weather/0/id: to get the weather condition id
    - weather/0/main: to get the group-name of weather parameters (Rain, Snow, Extreme etc.)
    - weather/0/description: to get the weather condition description within the group.
    - weather/0/icon: to get the weather icon id
    - pop: Propability of precipitation
- begins with "day/N/" where N is a number between 0 and 6. Be aware that -0 (see below) and 0 are returning different valid values! Original data-source is the onecall-API. As you are using a positive value for N (including 0) outlook data is retrieved. the prefix "day/" is replaced with "daily/" when matching items in the JSON-source. example: day/1/feels_like/night to get tomorrows perceived temperature at night. complete set of data-points that can be retrieved for each day:

    - dt: Point in time represented by this data-point
    - sunrise: Sunrise of this day, UTC
    - sunset: Sunset of this day, UTC
    - moonrise: Moonrise of this day, UTC
    - moonset: Moonset of this day, UTC
    - temp/morn: Morning temperature in Celsius.
    - temp/day: Day temperature in Celsius.
    - temp/eve: Evening temperature in Celsius.
    - temp/night: Night temperature in Celsius.
    - temp/min: Min daily temperature in Celsius.
    - temp/max: Max daily temperature in Celsius.
    - feels_like/morn: Perceived Morning Temperature
    - feels_like/day: Perceived Day Temperature
    - feels_like/eve: Perceived Evening Temperature
    - feels_like/night: Perceived Night Temperature
    - pressure: Atmospheric pressure on the sea level, hPa
    - humidity: Relative Humidity in %
    - dew_point: Atmospheric temperature (varying according to pressure and humidity) below which water droplets begin to condense and dew can form. Celsius
    - uvi: Maximum UV index for the day
    - clouds: Cloudiness %
    - rain: Rain volume in mm
    - snow: Snow volume in mm
    - pop: Propability of precipitation
    - visibility: Average visibility, metres
    - wind_speed: Wind speed in metre/sec (this can be extended as wind_speed/beaufort and wind_speed/description to get the Beaufort-value and the Description of the Speed-level in German or English)
    - wind_deg: Wind direction, degrees (meteorological)
    - wind_gust: Wind gust (peaks in speed) in metre/sec
    - weather/0/id: to get the weather condition id
    - weather/0/main: to get the group-name of weather parameters (Rain, Snow, Extreme etc.)
    - weather/0/description: to get the weather condition description within the group.
    - weather/0/icon: to get the weather icon id
- begins with "day/-N/" where N is a number between 0 and 4. Be aware that -0 and 0 (see above) are returning different valid values! Original data-source is the onecall-API with the time-machine feature. As you are using a negative value for N (including -0) historic data is retrieved. Appending an "hour/I/" to the matchstring results in selecting an hour "I" of that particular day. Warning: Accessing "day/-0/hour/18/..." at an earlier time than 6pm (UTC!!) will result in an ERROR as the API is not combining historic data with outlook data. Without appending hour, the daily summary will be retrieved (from the tree below "current/" within the JSON response). examples:

    - day/-1/hour/13/temp to get yesterdays temperature at 1pm UTC.
    - day/-2/pressure to get the average(?) air-pressure from the day before yesterday.

- begins with "airpollution" Retrieves Air-Quality-Index and air-pollution component values. Original data-source is the airpollution API. In general you can retrieve the following values:

    - airpollution/main/aqi to get the Air-Quality-Index
    - airpollution/components/co
    - airpollution/components/no
    - airpollution/components/no2
    - airpollution/components/o3
    - airpollution/components/so2
    - airpollution/components/pm2_5
    - airpollution/components/pm10
    - airpollution/components/nh3 You may insert "/day/-1/hour/11/" between airpollution and main or component, where days can range from -1 to -4 and hour from 0 to 23. With that you can retrieve values of a certain hour from that day in the past. In order to retrieve forecast values you may insert "/hour/11" (not prepended with a day). This will provide access to the next 72 hours of forecast. Examples:

        - airpollution/day/-1/hour/11/main/aqi yesterday at 12:00 UTC
        - airpollution/day/-4/hour/9/main/aqi four days into the past at 9:00 UTC
        - airpollution/hour/24/main/aqi tommorrow, same time

- ends with _new (see list below) prepares a map-layer URL either from the given parameters owm_coord_x, owm_coord_y, owm_coord_z or from a translation of the current geo-coordinates to the tile-information Complete list of map-layers:

    - clouds_new
    - precipitation_new
    - pressure_new
    - wind_new
    - temp_new

- everything else is tried to be matched against the weather-API. Complete list:

    - base / cod / sys/id / sys/type to get some internal parameters (if you can make sense of it).
    - coord/lon / coord/lat / id / name / sys/country / timezone for OWM's interpretation of your location data.
    - clouds/all / visibility to get the current cloud coverage and visibility range in meters.
    - dt / sys/sunrise / sys/sunset to get the request's time, sunrise and sunset time in UTC.
    - main/temp / main/feels_like / main/temp_max / main/temp_min to get current / today's temperature data.
    - rain/1h / rain/3h / snow/1h / snow/3h to get current precipitation data in mm
    - main/humidity / main/pressure to get current relative humidity (in %) and pressure values
    - weather/0/id to get the weather condition id
    - weather/0/main to get the group-name of weather parameters (Rain, Snow, Extreme etc.)
    - weather/0/description to get the weather condition description within the group.
    - weather/0/icon to get the weather icon id
    - wind/deg / wind/speed / wind/gust to get some facts about the wind (direction/speed/peak-speeds), (No Beaufort-suffixes possible here)


Matching lists
--------------
The weather-condition is stored as a list and can be correctly accessed via "current/weather/0/description". As the data-type list in "current/weather" is not obvious, the plugin will automatically insert a /0/ to match the first item of such list. Therefore "current/weather/description" will result in a value - and a WARNING in the log on every update. This feature is intended to find the issues easy and then permanently fix them by updating the matchstrings in your configuration.
In case you are working with dynamic lists such as "alerts" that might contain no to an undefined amount of data you can make use of the "@count"-directive in order to retrieve the number of records in that list. An example is "current/weather/@count" (always 1) or "alerts/@count", making a lot more sense.


Virtual matchstrings
--------------------
Not all data can be directly retrieved via any API, some data needs to be aggregated via multiple data-sources. If you want to know the amount of rain of the past 24 hours at 10am you would need to query todays and yesterdays data and then summarize the data. This feature is built into the plugin. Virtual matchstrings are prefixed with the keyword "virtual".

.. code:: yaml

    owm:
        rain_past_24h:
            type: num
            owm_matchstring@home: virtual/past24h/sum/rain/1h
        rain_next_24h:
            type: num
            owm_matchstring@home: virtual/next24h/sum/rain/1h
        avg_wind_next_24h:
            type: num
            owm_matchstring@home: virtual/next24h/avg/wind_speed
        max_wind_next_12h:
            type: num
            owm_matchstring@home: virtual/next12h/max/wind_gust

The virtual matchstrings consist of the following elements:

- prefix "virtual"
- a time-frame that could be:

    - past12h
    - next3d
    - ... The time-frame is compiled from a statement about the direction (past or next) a numeric literal and the unit, which could be "h" or "d" for hours or days. The maximum numbers are:
    - next6d
    - next48h
    - past4d
    - past96h

- an aggregation-function:

    - sum
    - max
    - min
    - avg
    - all (to generate a list with all items)

- a matchstring that would match an element in the hourly one-call API.

CAVE: For values as next#d the daily fields from the same API are matched!

An example usage of those virtual matchstrings is the rain_overview-widget for SmartVisu provided with this plugin:

.. code:: yaml

    weather:
        as_of:
            type: num
            remark: This has to be a time-stamp to work properly, so no eval here
            owm_matchstring: current/dt
        rain_past_12h:
            type: list
            owm_matchstring@home: virtual/past12h/all/rain/1h
        rain_next_12h:
            type: list
            owm_matchstring@home: virtual/next12h/all/rain/1h

.. code:: html

    {{ owm.rain_overview('visual_id', 'weather.rain_past_12h', 'weather.rain_next_12h', 'weather.as_of') }}


Daily forecast (calculated)
---------------------------
Another type of virtual matchstrings are the values selected by a "forecast/daily/N/..."-matchstring. N represents a value between 0 and 4, where 0 represents tomorrow, 1 the day after tomorrow, etc. Here the forecast-data source is used. You may suffix "/min" or "/max" to the match-string in order to retrieve the respective aggregation. By default the average value is returned.

.. code:: yaml

    owm:
        home:
            forecast_daily0:
                temp:
                    type: num
                    owm_matchstring@home: forecast/daily/0/main/temp

                temp_min:
                    type: num
                    owm_matchstring@home: forecast/daily/0/main/temp_min/min

                temp_max:
                    type: num
                    owm_matchstring@home: forecast/daily/0/main/temp_max/max


Evapotranspiration
------------------
The Evapotranspiration considers effects like wind, solar radiation (even indirect on cloudy days), pressure and relative humidity to calculate the loss of water from the ground by evaporation. The original data-source for the components considered is the one-call API. The resulting value is a demand for irrigation in mm. This can be set in relation with the fallen rain to identify the real need.
Examples for matchstrings:

    - current/eto / daily/0/eto get today's ETO
    - daily/1/eto

More information can be retrieved at the original implementation found here: (https://github.com/MTry/homebridge-smart-irrigation)
The implementation of the calculation is based on: (https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/ae/ae45900.pdf) and explained here: (http://www.fao.org/3/X0490E/x0490e00.htm#Contents)
Caveat: The formula used for ETO calculation makes use of a solar radiation feature. Unfortunately this value is not available for free via API. Luckily the UV-index matches the scale and should be somewhat equivalent to the actual value, so this is used in the calculation instead. Still: The usage of the UV-index instead of a real solar radiation feature is scientifically WRONG.


Weather alerts
--------------

Weather alerts are forwarded from the respective authority, e.g. the "Deutscher Wetterdienst". If there is an alert, typically two items are added to the list, one in the national language and another one in English. The plugin is ensuring there is always at least one alarm. If there is no alarm condition the plugin is adding a "Placebo"-Alert that is described as "No Alert". This is done to ensure that the matchstring "alerts/0/event" will always return a value, otherwise not even the "alerts"-node is defined in the API-response, resulting in ERROR-messages in the log. By using "alerts/@count" one can identify whether there is an alert or not. If only the placebo-alert is defined, "alerts/@count" will return the numerical value "0", although there is an item in the list.
One way to display the alerts in the SmartVisu is the usage of the status.activelist-widget:

.. code:: html

    {{ status.activelist('', 'weather.alerts', 'event', 'start', 'description', '') }}



Methods / Functions
===================


get_beaufort_number(value_in_meter_per_second)
----------------------------------------------
Translate wind speed or wind gust from m/s into beaufort scale number (Windstärke)


get_beaufort_description(bft_number)
------------------------------------
Translate beaufort scale number into beaufort scale description (Windstärke)



Configuration
=============


Plugin
------
The plugin can be activated and configured via the Admin Interface.

The API-Key is needed for Plugin Configuration.
In addition the following parameters can be set:
- local position of the point of interest (Default: data from shNG out of etc/smarthome.yaml will be used)
- language
- cycle time
- instance

Note: The following configuration examples for items and structs require a definition of an instance ("home"). 


Items
-----
In order to access the data that can be retrieved via the API an attribute of "owm_matchstring" is needed. Optionally you can add a "owm_match_prefix". That string is prepended to the "owm_matchstring" given. This allows better structing.
Please note to take care of the instance (here @home) for proper working.

.. code:: yaml

    forecast_daily1_no_prefix:
        type: str
        remark: This is a valid way of adressing the description of tomorrows weather
        owm_matchstring@home: day/1/weather/0/description

    forecast_daily1_with_prefix:
        type: str
        remark: here the match-string is compiled as day/1/weather/0/description
        owm_match_prefix@home: day/1
        owm_matchstring@home: /weather/0/description

        temp_night:
            type: num
            remark: here the match-string is compiled as day/1/temp/night, inheriting the prefix from the parent-element.
            owm_match_prefix@home: ../.
            owm_matchstring@home: /temp/night

Here follows a complete item.yaml for that plugin. Please keep in mind to adapt the plugin instance (here "home") and plugin name (here "_priv_openweathermap") to your configuration.

You can use the irrigation struct to switch an irrigation valve (solenoid) off automatically, based on the daily watering demand. If you combine that with an uzsu you will be able to even start the irrigation automatically. Using this method you will be able to water your plant based on the demand and not perform irrigation if there was enough rain.

Irrigation control for weekly irrigation (lawn)
-----------------------------------------------
You can use the irrigation_weekly struct to switch an irrigation valve (solenoid) off automatically, based on the weekly watering demand. If you combine that with an uzsu you will be able to even start the irrigation automatically. Using this method you will be able to water your lawn based on the demand and not perform irrigation if there was enough rain.
In this case the past 4 days are considered and the outlook of the next 3 days.

Web Interface des Plugins
=========================


OWM Items
------------

The Webinterface tab "items" shows all items, for witch a OWM Input has been configured.

Listed and periodicly updated is:
    - item path
    - item type
    - owm_matchstring
    - item value
    - date and trigger of last update
    - date of last change


JSON
----

The tab "JSON" contains a menu for selecting the different openweathermap apis and the raw data in JSON format.


Tipps and Tricks
================
To convert the time in the dt values to a local value you may want to use an eval string and generate a printable value.

.. code:: yaml

    conditions_as_of:
          type: str
          owm_matchstring: day/1/dt
          eval: datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(value, datetime.timezone.utc).astimezone().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z%z')



Caveats
=======
- All times are in UTC. So if you query "yesterdays" values for Germany you will have a 1hr or 2hr time-frame from the next day and a missing time-frame of the same day.
- The formula used for ETO calculation makes use of a solar radiation feature. Unfortunately this value is not available for free via API. Luckily the UV-index matches the scale and should be somewhat equivalent to the actual value, so this is used in the calculation instead. Still: The usage of the UV-index instead of a real solar radiation feature is scientifically WRONG.
- For an unknown reason "weather" is a list, so you have to use "weather/0/id" to get the id value.
