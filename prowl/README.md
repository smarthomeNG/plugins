Requirements
============
This plugin has no requirements or dependencies.

Configuration
=============

plugin.conf
-----------
<pre>[notify]
    class_name = Prowl
    class_path = plugins.prowl
    apikey = asdf1234asdf1234 # secret global key for prowl
    instance = Whatever # Instance name displayed in messages
</pre>

### Attributes
   * `apikey`: this attribute is optional. You could define a global apikey for the prowl service.
   * `instance`: this attribute is optional. If set it will be displayed in prowl messages.

Functions
=========
Because there is only one function you could access it directly by the object. With the above example it would look like this: `sh.notify('Intrusion', 'Living room window broken!')`
This function takes several arguments:

 1. event: type of event.
 2. description: describes the event.
 3. priority: you could give a priority (0-2) to differentiate beetween events on your mobile device.
 4. url: This url would be linked to the notification.
 5. apikey: you could specify an individual apikey.
 6. application: describes the name of the application. By default it is SmartHome.

<pre># some examples
sh.notify('Intrusion', 'Living room window broken', 2, 'http://yourvisu.com/')
sh.notify('Tumbler', 'finished', apikey='qwerqwer')
</pre>
