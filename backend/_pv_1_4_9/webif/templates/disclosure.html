    <div><strong>Font Awesome Free License:</strong></div><br/>
    Font Awesome Free is free, open source, and GPL friendly. You can use it for
    commercial projects, open source projects, or really almost whatever you want.
    Full Font Awesome Free license: <a href="https://fontawesome.com/license" target="_blank">https://fontawesome.com/license</a>.
<br/><br/>
    # Icons:<br/>
    CC BY 4.0 License (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a>)
    In the Font Awesome Free download, the CC BY 4.0 license applies to all icons
    packaged as SVG and JS file types.
<br/><br/>
    # Fonts:<br/>
    SIL OFL 1.1 License (<a href="https://scripts.sil.org/OFL" target="_blank">https://scripts.sil.org/OFL</a>)
    In the Font Awesome Free download, the SIL OLF license applies to all icons
    packaged as web and desktop font files.
<br/><br/>
    # Code:<br/>
    MIT License (<a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" target="_blank">https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT</a>)
    In the Font Awesome Free download, the MIT license applies to all non-font and
    non-icon files.
<br/><br/>
    # Attribution<br/>
    Attribution is required by MIT, SIL OLF, and CC BY licenses. Downloaded Font
    Awesome Free files already contain embedded comments with sufficient
    attribution, so you shouldn't need to do anything additional when using these
    files normally.
<br/><br/>
    We've kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work
    to remove them from files, especially code. They're a great way for folks to
    learn about Font Awesome.
<br/><br/>
    # Brand Icons<br/>
    All brand icons are trademarks of their respective owners. The use of these
    trademarks does not indicate endorsement of the trademark holder by Font
    Awesome, nor vice versa. **Please do not use brand logos for any purpose except
    to represent the company, product, or service to which they refer.**
