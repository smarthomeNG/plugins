### <a name="req"></a>Requirements

* SmarthomeNG v1.3 or newer
* Python3 libraries ```requests``` and ```xmltodict```
* available ```ping``` executable on the host system

To install all necessary libraries for SmarthomeNG, you can run following bash command:
```bash
sudo pip3 install -r /usr/local/smarthome/requirements/all.txt
```
Change the path ```/usr/local/smarthome``` to your SmarthomeNG base directory.

For any questions, bug reports and feature requests, please post to the 
[Sonos-Plugin thread](https://knx-user-forum.de/forum/supportforen/smarthome-py/25151-sonos-anbindung) in the
[KNX-User-Forum](https://knx-user-forum.de/). 

### <a name="uid"></a>Sonos Speaker UID
Before you can start, you have to find all UIDs of your Sonos Speaker in the network. Therefor you can use the
```search_uids.py``` script in the plugin folder. Execute the script on your console via:

```python3 search_uids.py```

The output should be just about like this:
```bash

---------------------------------------------------------
rincon_000f448c3392a01411
        ip           : 192.168.1.100
        speaker name : Wohnzimmer 
        speaker model: Sonos PLAY:1 

---------------------------------------------------------
rincon_c7e91735d19711411
        ip           : 192.168.1.99
        speaker name : Kinderzimmer 
        speaker model: Sonos PLAY:3 
---------------------------------------------------------
```
The first line of each entry is our UID (rincon_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx) we were looking for.

### <a name="sh"></a>Smarthome Integration

Edit the file ```/usr/local/smarthome/etc/plugins.conf``` (might differ) and add the following entry:
```yaml
[sonos]
    class_name = Sonos
    class_path = plugins.sonos
    discover_cycle = 120 # can be omitted, default 120 seconds
```
After that you have to create an item configuration file under ```/usr/local/smarthome/items```, e.g. ```sonos.yaml```.
You can use the full-featured example configuration in the example sub folder. Just change the [Sonos UID](#uid) to your
needs.

### <a name="struc"></a>Item Structure 
The first thing to mention is that you don't have to implement all items / functions for a speaker. Choose your
functionality and all the relevant items. To get the Sonos widget working you have at least to implement all items
marked with ```visu``` in the items description below. This list is updated if a new functionality is implemented in the 
widget. 

Every item is described by one or more additional tags in the item description below: ```read```, ```write``` and 
```visu```. These attributes indicates whether an item is readable and/or writeable.    

For a minimal functionality you have to set up an item with the attribute 'sonos_uid' and at least one child item.
Example:
```yaml
MyRoom:
    MySonos:
        sonos_uid: rincon_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
        
        play:
            type: bool
            sonos_recv: play
            sonos_send: play
```

The level of the item with the attribute 'sonos_uid' doesn't matter, the below example is also possible.
Example:
```yaml
MyRoom:
    parent:
        child:
        ...
        
        child2:
        ...
        
        child3:
            MySonos:
                sonos_uid: rincon_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    
                play:
                  type: bool
                  sonos_recv: play
                  sonos_send: play
```
You can multiple use the same Sonos speaker for your items. The only requirement for a Sonos item is the parent item 
with the sonos uid. 
Example:
```yaml
Kitchen:
    child1:
        MySonos:
            sonos_uid: rincon_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
            
            play:
                type: bool
                sonos_recv: play
                sonos_send: play
        
        child2:
            MySonos2:
            sonos_uid: rincon_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
            
            play:
                type: bool
                sonos_recv: play
                sonos_send: play
            stop:
                type: bool
                sonos_recv: stop
                sonos_send: stop
```
Last but not least you can rename the item name. This is not recommended due to the fact, that (only) the Sonos widget 
depends on that names (of course you can edit the sonos.html to adapt the widget to your changes).  
Example:
```yaml
MyRoom:
    MySonos:
        sonos_uid: rincon_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
        
        my_awesome_mute_item_name:
            type: bool
            sonos_recv: mute
            sonos_send: mute
```

```yaml
volume:
    ...

```
Make sure you also add the shown helper item. You can change the fade steps [```sonos_dpt3_step```] and the time per 
step in seconds ```[sonos_dpt3_time]```. Both values can be omitted. In this case the default values are: 
```sonos_dpt3_step: 2``` and ```sonos_dpt3_step: 1```. The ```group_command``` and ```max_volume``` items will be 
considered.

### <a name="visu"></a>SmartVISU Integration

The Sonos Plugin fulfills all requirements for an automatic integration in SmartVISU via the **visu_websocket** and
**visu_smartvisu** plugins (for detailed information follow this 
[link](https://github.com/smarthomeNG/smarthome/wiki/Visu_smartvisu_autogen_in_v1.2)). 

#### Sonos widget via plugin
To install / show the Sonos widget via the ```visu_smartvisu``` plugin, you have to [set up the mentioned plugin 
properly](https://github.com/smarthomeNG/plugins/blob/develop/visu_smartvisu/README.md). After that you can define a 
page item like that:
```yaml
MyPage:
    name: Sonos
    sv_page: room
    sv_img: audio_audio.svg

    sonos:
      name: Sonos Kitchen
      visu_acl: rw
      sv_blocksize: 1 # optional
      sv_widget: "{{ sonos.player('sonos_kueche', 'MySonos.Kueche') }}"
```
The important entry here is ```{{ sonos.player('sonos_kueche', 'MySonos.Kueche') }}```.  The first value is a 
self-defined unique identifier, the second value is the full path of the Sonos item which you want to control. If you 
have more than one Sonos widget per page, make sure you set an **unique** identifier for each widget.

#### Manual setup
Copy the file ```widget_sonos.html``` from the ```sv_widget``` folder to your smartVISU directory, e.g.
```bash
/var/www/smartvisu/pages/YOUR_PATH_HERE 
```
Change to this directory and append the content of ```widget_sonos.js``` (also located in the sv_widget directory) 
to ```visu.js``` and ```widget_sonos.css``` to ```visu.css```. Create both files if they do not not exist.

Edit your page where you want to display the widget and add the following code snippet:
```html
{% import "widget_sonos.html" as sonos %}
{% block content %}

<div class="block">
  <div class="set-2" data-role="collapsible-set" data-theme="c" data-content-theme="a" data-mini="true">
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="false" >
      {{ sonos.player('sonos_kueche', 'Sonos.Kueche') }}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

{% endblock %}

```

### <a name="best"></a>Best practise

#### Group commands
As you can see, some of the items have an additional child item "group_command". You can ommit this child item, then 
the default value is always ```False```. If you set the```group_command``` item to ```True``` the value from the parent
item( e.g. ```volume```) will be set to all members of the speaker's group. To get all UIDs of a group you can check the 
the item ```zone_group_members```.

**Important**: Some of the items ​​always act as a group commands. Here is list of all relevant item:
  
```
play
pause
stop
mute
cross_fade
snooze
play_mode
next
previous
play_tunein
play_url
load_sonos_playlist
```
For this items you don't have to pay attention to which speaker of the group you have to send the command. This is done 
automatically and affects all speakers of the group.

#### Do not stress the discover functionality
You can define the parameter 'discover_cycle' on plugin start to set the interval how often the plugin searches for 
new and / or offline speakers in the network. Due to the initialization of the speakers and network traffic, it is 
not recommended to set the value less than 60 seconds.

#### Use the "is_initialized" item

It takes some time to discover all Sonos speakers in the network. Use the "is_initialized" item for your logic. If true,
the speaker is fully functional. If this item is 'False' the speaker is not yet initialized or offline.

Example
```python
if sh.MySonosPlayer.is_initialized():
    do_something()
```
#### "Non-realtime" items
Some properties are not event-driver. That means they are not updated by the Sonos event system. These properties are:

snooze
status_light

These values are updated periodically with each speaker discovery cycle.

#### Yaml or "classical" item configuration
The plugin comes with an example in yaml format. This will be the preferable format for the SamrthomeNG item 
configuration in the future. Feel free to change this example  to the "classical" format. SmarthomeNG is 
backward-compatible.

This example shows a yaml config and the 'classic' pendant: 
```yaml
MySonos:
  Kueche:
    sonos_uid: rincon_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

    is_initialized:
      type: bool
      sonos_recv: is_initialized

    volume:
      type: num
      sonos_recv: volume
      sonos_send: volume

      group_command:
        type: bool
        value: false
        sonos_attrib: group

    play:
      type: bool
      sonos_recv: play
      sonos_send: play
      
      .....
```
becomes 
```yaml
[MySonos]
    [[Kueche]]
        sonos_uid = rincon_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

        [[[is_initialized]]]
            type =bool
            sonos_recv = is_initialized

        [[[volume]]
            type = num
            sonos_recv = volume
            sonos_send = volume
            [[[[group_command]]]]
                type = bool
                value = false
                sonos_attrib = group
    
        [[[play]]]
