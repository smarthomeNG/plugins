# Robonect Plugin
#### Version 1.0.5

Renamed remotestart_1/2.path to remotestart_1/2.rstart_path because of collissions with path attribute of item class

#### Version 1.0.3

Plugin for reading data from Husqvarna, Gardena, Flymo or McCulloch robotic lawnmowers, equipped with the Robonect Hx module.
In later stages of development, it will also be possible to control the robot via the plugin as far as the Robonect API supports this.
