""" commands for dev example

This section consists of a single dict which defines all the devices' commands.
The first example illustrates the generic syntax and the possible attributes and
the second example shows nested command definitions.

If models are defined and commands with the same name are identical on different
models, this definition syntax can be used. For specifying which commands are
present on which model, see below.
Alternatively, if commands with the same name are different on different models,
see the third example for commands definition.

In the first example, only one command is given to define possible keys and their
values' meaning.

If many commands are present, it might be beneficial to create a hierarchical

used as you like.

are:

* level1a.level2a.cmd1
* level1a.level2b.cmd1
* level1a.level2b.cmd2

Note that the two commands 'cmd1' are completely independent, as the internal
name includes the full path.

Different models of a type (eg. different heating models of the same manufacturer
or different AV receivers of the same series) might require different command
sets.

This - optional - dict allows to specify sets of commands which are supported
by different models. The keys are the model names and the values are lists of
all commands supported by the respective model. Commands listed under the
special - optional - key `ALL` are added to all models.

If the device is configured without a model name, all commands will be available.
If the device is configured with a model name not listed here (but the ``models``
dict is present), the device will not load.
If the device is configured with a model name, but the ``models`` dict is not
present, the device will have all commands available.

this dict will be ignored.

""" lookup: (optional) definition of lookup tables (see commands table)

Each table is a plain dict containing device values as keys and corresponding
SmartHomeNG item values as values. Lookup tables are used both for forward
(device -> shng) and reverse (shng -> device) lookups. By default, reverse
lookups are case insensitive to allow for typos.

The lookups dict can have two forms:

a) without the ability to contain model specific data
b) with the ability to contain model specific data

Case a) is the easier one: each key is a lookup table name and each value is
a plain dict with ``<device value>: <shng item value>`` dict entries.

Example:
"""

lookups = {
    'table1': {
        1: 'foo',
        2: 'bar',

Case b) is basically the same, but with an additional first level inserted.
The first level MUST contain a key named 'ALL' (duh), which specifies
"generic" lookup tables valid for all models. The value to this key is a dict
like the one in case a).
The first level CAN (and should, why would you do it otherwise?) have
additional entries named for the supported models. Its value again is a dict
like the one in case a). These entries are ADDED to the generic entries,
while tables existent in both are taken from the model-specific dict.

In the following example, all models will use ``table1`` and ``table2``;
both model1 and model2 will have the additional ``table3``, while only
model1 has a modified ``table1``.
