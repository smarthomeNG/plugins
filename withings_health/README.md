# Withings Health

## Description

This plugin allows to retrieve data from the Withings (former Nokia) Health API (https://developer.withings.com/api). Currently it 
only has support for "Withings WS-50 Smart Body Analyzer", a wifi capabale scale.

## Requirements

This plugin requires lib nokia. You can install this lib with: 

```bash
sudo pip3 install nokia --upgrade
```

You have to register at https://account.withings.com/partner/add_oauth2.
The callback URL to enter when registering is shown via the plugin's web interface and can be added as soon as client_id and consumer_secret have been set in etc/plugin.yaml

The OAuth2 process can then be triggered via the Web Interface of the plugin. Therefore at least the first four items of the example below need to exist (access_token, token_expiry, token_type, refresh_token).

In case your SmartHomeNG instance is offline for too long, the tokens expire. You then have to start the OAuth2 process via the Web Interface again. Errors will be logged in this case!

## Configuration

### plugin.yaml
```yaml
withings_health: 
    class_name: WithingsHealth
    class_path: plugins.withings_health
    user_id: <your user id>
    client_id: <your client id>
    consumer_secret: <your consumer secret>
    cycle: 300
    instance: withings_health
    
```

### items.yaml

Please be aware that there are dependencies for the values. E.g. the body measurement index will only be calculated if a
height exists. From what i saw so far is, that the height is transmitted only one time, the first time the scale 
communicates with the Withings (former Nokia) servers. In case you miss it, set the item value manually!

The first four items are mandatory, as they are needed for OAuth2 data!
