## Configuration

### plugin.yaml

```
cli:
    class_name: CLI
    class_path: plugins.cli
    # ip = 127.0.0.1
    # port = 2323
    # update = false
    # hashed_password = 1245a9633edf47b7091f37c4d294b5be5a9936c81c5359b16d1c4833729965663f1943ef240959c53803fedef7ac19bd59c66ad7e7092d7dbf155ce45884607d
```

This plugin listens for a telnet connection.

``ip = `` used network interface, e.g. 127.0.0.1 (localhost, default) or listen on all network interfaces: 0.0.0.0
``port =`` used network port, default 2323
``update =`` restrict the access of the items to read only (false, default) or allows read/write access (true)
``hashed_password = `` password that needs to be entered on login. SHA-512 hashed. Value shown above is "very_secure_password"

The hashed_password can be obtained by using the backend's service page and the hash generator.

## Usage

Telnet to the configured IP adress and port.
