### Attributes:
* `model`: string. name of AV device. Has to correspond to a text file with the same name in the folder plugins/avdevice.
* `instance`: string. define instance name, each device needs an individual instance name!
* `tcp`: list of values. if you use TCP connection define IP address and port, separated by a ","
* `rs232`: list of values. if you use a RS232 cable to communicate with your device (highly recommended!) define port, baudrate, timeout and write timeout separated by ","
* `ignoreresponse`: list of values. the plugin doesn't care about responses from the device starting with the given values. List responses for menu navigation, etc. For Pioneer receivers the following list is recommended: RGB, RGC, RGD, GBH, GHH, LM0, VTA, AUA, AUB
* `forcedbuffer`: list of strings. If for whatever reason you don't want to buffer the response from your device you can still define specific responses that should get buffered. This is important for responses that change or get sent very quickly. Artist, title, radio station, etc. are examples that should be put here. For Pioneer receivers the following list is recommended: GEH01020, GEH04022, GEH05024
* `inputignoredisplay`: list of int. The value of the LCD display on your receiver might get updated very often, e.g. when it shows song titles as a scrolling text. To avoid constant display updates and therefore possible confusion with relevant answers of your device listing source inputs like internet radio, LAN streaming, etc. here is highly recommended. For Pioneer receivers the following list is recommended: 26,38,40,41,44,17,02,48,0
* `dependson`: item, value. If given item has given value the commands are sent to the device, otherwise they are not. Relevant if you have your device connected to a power socket that can be turned off.
* `errorresponse`: list of strings. The standard error responses from your device. For Pioneer receivers they are "E" followed by a number. If no values are provided error answers from your device might get recognized much slower but actually should still get recognized. 
* `resetonerror`: boolean. Reset the value of the item that could not be updated. E.g. you set the volume of zone 2 to "100". If either the dependson item is off or the device sends an error response or after several connection and send retries the expected response is not received, the volume item gets set to value it had before you sent the command. That way you avoid having a wrong value displayed in your Visu.
* `depend0_power0`: boolean. If the dependson item is off the power off all zones are set to off. This is especially relevant for a correct representation in your Visu when you have a powered on device but turn off the power socket.
* `depend0_volume0`: boolean. Same as above but in this case the volume is set to 0 for all zones. This is for Visu purposes only.
* `sendretries`: integer. This value defines how often a command should be sent when receiving a wrong answer from the device.
* `resendwait`: float. Seconds the plugin should wait between each resend retry.
* `reconnectretries`: integer. If the plugin can not connect to the device it retries this often. This is especially useful for TCP connections on devices that are plugged into a switchable socket as most receivers need about 40-50 seconds to boot their network device. 
* `reconnectcycle`: integer. Seconds the plugin should wait between each reconnect retry.
* `secondstokeep`: integer. Seconds the plugin should temporarily save a command to retry later on after establishing a connection. This is especially useful for TCP connections on devices that are plugged into a switchable socket as most receivers need about 40-50 seconds to boot their network device. 
* `responsebuffer`: integer or boolean. Set this to a negative number to collect quickly received responses in a buffer and evaluate them collectively. The standard value should be fine and prevent responses getting lost. Some receivers might first respond to a command with an update of the display and then with the actual value. The buffer ensures the correct evaluation of the response. 
* `autoreconnect`: boolean. Automatically tries to reconnect if no response is received or connection is lost. This should not be necessary as the plugin always tries to reconnect before sending a command.


## items.yaml

### avdevice_zone[0-4]@[instance]: [command]

specifiy the zone number and instance.
The command has to correspond to a "base" command in the relevant text configuration file in the avdevice plugin folder named the same as the "model" configured in plugin.yaml.
Only use the first part of the command before the space, e.g. "power" instead of "power on" or "power off". "volume" instead of "volume set", etc.

## model.txt

### ZONE;FUNCTION;SEND;QUERY;RESPONSE;READWRITE;INVERTRESPONSE;MAXVALUE;TYPE

Configure your commands depending on your model and manufacturer. You have to name the file the same as configured in the plugin.yaml as "model". E.g. if you've configured "model: vsx-923" you name the file "vsx-923.txt"

Each line holds one specific command that should be sent to the device. You also specify the zone, the query command, response command, etc.

* `zone`: Number of zone. Has to correspond to the attribute in item.yaml. E.g. for zone 1 use "avdevice_zone1: command". Zone 0 holds special commands like navigating in the menu, display reponse, information about currently playing songs, etc.

* `function`: name of the function. You can name them whatever you like but keep in mind the following scheme: for boolean functions add a " on" or " off" to the function name. For commands setting a specific value like source, input mode, volume, etc. add a " set"

* `send`: the command to be sent, e.g. power off is "PF" for Pioneer receivers. You can use a pipe "|" if more than one command should be sent. That might be necessary for power on commands via RS232, e.g. for Pioneer receivers to power on "PO|PO" forces the plugin to send the "PO" command twice. Use stars "\*" to specify the format of the value to be sent. Let's say your device expects the value for volume as 3 digits, a "\*\*\*VL" ensures that even setting the volume to "5" sends the command as "005VL"

* `query`: Query command. This is usually useful after setting up the connection or turning on the power. This command gets also used if the plugin doesn't receive the correct answer after sending a command.

* `response`: The expected response after sending a command. Use "none" if you don't want to wait for the correct response. You can use stars "\*" again to ensure that the exact correct value is set. Example: You set the volume to 100. If you want to ensure that the device responds with any value for volume just use "VOL" here (or whatever response your device sends). If you want to ensure that the device is set to a volume of 100, use stars as placeholders, e.g. "VOL\*\*\*" for 3 digits.

* `readwrite`: R for read only, W for write only, RW for Read and Write. E.g. display values are read only whereas turning the volume up might be a write operation only. Setting this correctly ensures a fast and reliable plugin operation

* `invertresponse`: some devices are stupid enough to reply with a "0" for "on" and "1" for "off". E.g. a Pioneer receiver responds with "PWR0" if the device is turned on. Configure with "yes" if your device is quite stupid, too.

* `maxvalue`: You can define the maximum value for setting a specific function. This might be most relevant for setting the volume. If you configure this with "100" and set the volume to "240" (via Visu or CLI) the value will get clamped by the plugin and set to "100". 

* `type`: If you want to force a function to deal with boolean values, use "bool" here. This might be necessary when your device responds in a weird way like an Epson projector does. It responds with "PWR=01" or "PWR=02" when turned on.. depending on it's mood ;)
