# smarthome-buderus

Plugin to control Buderus boilers using an additional Logamatic web KM200 module. Logamatic web KM50 and KM300 modules should also be supported.


## Notes
This plugin is still __under development__! I use this plugin to lower heating when no presence is detected for longer period or when the alarm system is activated.

## Prerequisite
The following python packages need to be installed on your system:
- urllib
- crypto

You need to generate a key from your a) device password, printed on a sticker and b) from your user defined password used to access EasyControl App for example.


## Installation

```
cd smarthome.py directory
cd plugins
git clone https://github.com/rthill/buderus.git
```

### plugin.conf

```
[buderus]
class_name = Buderus
class_path = plugins.buderus
host = <ip_address>
key = <key generated from https://ssl-account.com/km200.andreashahn.info/>
cycle = 900 # default every 15 minutes
```

### items.conf

```
