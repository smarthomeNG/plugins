If you figure out further configurations different than my 5576-003,
please feel free to rename and adjust these files and send them back to me for integration into the project.

Thesniffers in the 'tools' folder will help you finding out which coils/registers are accessible.

Note: You can read out only approx. 120 registers at a time.
Reading full the range of 0..65535 will therefore take hours, even with the automatic sniffers.
